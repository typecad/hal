/**
 * Esp32Strategy — lowers TypeCAD HAL operation IR to native ESP-IDF driver
 * API calls. Subclasses ArduinoStrategy (mirroring NativeAVRStrategy on AVR)
 * and overrides only ESP32-specific emit behavior. The Toolchain export
 * (src/toolchain/index.ts) replaces the parent's arduino-cli toolchain
 * entirely with native idf.py.
 *
 * `id` stays as the inherited literal "arduino" — TypeScript variance rules
 * forbid re-declaring a readonly literal-narrowed property with a different
 * value in a subclass. The distinct identity of framework-esp32 is carried
 * by the package name (selected via the user's `framework` config field),
 * not by strategy.id. Same tradeoff framework-avr makes.
 *
 * See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-framework-esp32-design.md.
