# @typecad/arduino-cli

## 1.0.0-alpha.6

### Patch Changes

- Version-align `@typecad/arduino-cli` with the fixed release group after adding it to the `fixed` list in the changesets config. No functional change.

## 1.0.0-alpha.4

### Minor Changes

- ## cuttlefish licenses + doctor: license compliance auditing

  New CLI commands for environment verification and license compliance auditing of
  Arduino dependencies.

  ### `cuttlefish licenses [--all] [--strict]` (new)

  Audits the SPDX licenses of the Arduino libraries a project depends on, with
  copyleft risk classification. Resolves each library's license from
  `library.properties` → `LICENSE` file → source-header comment, normalized via a
  static SPDX table (MIT, BSD-2/3, Apache-2.0, LGPL-2.1/3.0, GPL-2.0/3.0,
  AGPL-3.0, Unlicense, CC-BY/SA/NC-4.0, including `-only`/`-or-later` variants).

  **Project-scoped by default.** Resolves the project's library set from the
  generated `.ino`'s `#include` directives (authoritative — exactly what
  arduino-cli links), with a config-derived display/touch fallback when no `.ino`
  exists. `--all` restores system-wide scanning of every installed library.

  **Four-layer header resolution** (project scope), in order:

  1. User libraries (`arduino-cli lib list`) → resolved with license
  2. Core-bundled libraries (the project's own board core, derived from the FQBN
     via `arduino-cli config dump`) → resolved with license (e.g. `Wire` →
     `LGPL-2.1`, read from its header notice)
  3. Toolchain headers (`avr/*.h`, `util/*.h` from avr-libc) → gray
     `CORE/TOOLCHAIN` row, not flagged as missing
  4. Not installed → red `NOT INSTALLED` (the actionable missing-dependency case)

  Output sorts worst-first: strong copyleft `[COPYLEFT]`, weak copyleft
  `[weak copyleft]`, permissive `✓`, then unknown `UNKNOWN`. `--strict` exits
  non-zero on unknown licenses or missing dependencies (CI-enforceable).

  ### `cuttlefish doctor` (new)

  Verifies `arduino-cli` is installed and the board core for the configured
  `buildTarget` (FQBN) is present, with the exact `arduino-cli core install`
  command to fix a missing core.

  ### Resolver + detection improvements

  - **Library name normalization**: bare import specifiers with underscores
    (`Adafruit_ILI9341`) now correctly resolve to libraries whose arduino-cli
    name uses spaces (`Adafruit ILI9341`), instead of falling back to a
    PascalCase header guess. Fixes `licenses` falsely reporting libraries as
    not-installed.
  - **Broadened license detection** for real-world Arduino libraries: British
    `LICENCE.txt` spelling, `LICENSE` under `src/`, source-header comment scanning
    (the Adafruit pattern), short-form markers (`BSD license`, `Apache License`),
    and the `SPDX-License-Identifier:` marker with `-only`/`-or-later` suffixes.
  - **Project-local header exclusion**: headers co-located with the `.ino`
    (cuttlefish-emitted polyfills) are recognized as project code, not missing
    libraries.
